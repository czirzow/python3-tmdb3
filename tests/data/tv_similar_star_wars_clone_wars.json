            "overview": "Star Trek: Deep Space Nine is a science fiction television series set in the Star Trek universe.\n\nThe show is set in the Milky Way galaxy, in the years 2369 - 2375. Unlike the other Star Trek TV shows, it takes place on a space station instead of a starship, so as not to have two series with starships at the same time. This made continuing story arcs and the appearance of recurring characters much more feasible. The show is noted for its well-developed characters and its original, complex plots. The series depended on darker themes, less physical exploration of space, and an emphasis on many aspects of war.\n\nDS9 premiered in 1993 and ran for seven seasons, ending in 1999. Rooted in Gene Roddenberry\u2019s Star Trek universe, it was the first Trek spin-off created without direct involvement from Roddenberry, although he did give his blessing to the concept shortly before his death in 1991. The series was created by Rick Berman and Michael Piller, at the request of Brandon Tartikoff, and produced by Paramount Television. Key writers, in addition to Berman and Piller, included showrunner Ira Steven Behr, Robert Hewitt Wolfe, Ronald D. Moore, Peter Allan Fields, Bradley Thompson, David Weddle, Hans Beimler, and Ren\u00e9 Echevarria.",

The animated series was aired under the name Star Trek, but it has become widely known under this longer name to differentiate it from the original live-action Star Trek. The success in syndication of the original live action series and fan pressure for a Star Trek revival led to The Animated Series from 1973\u20131974, as the source of new adventures of the Enterprise crew, the next being the 1979 live-action feature film Star Trek: The Motion Picture. The 'TAS' series was the original cast's last episodic portrayal of the characters until the \"cartoon like\" graphics of the Star Trek: 25th Anniversary computer game in 1992, as well as its sequel Star Trek: Judgment Rites in 1993, both of which appeared after the cast's last movie together in 1991's Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country. TAS was the first Star Trek series to win an Emmy Award.",
